# Carson Bring - Project #1
(this includes the demo)
##### created with springboot + gradle + groovy

## Required packages
* Gradle [IF YOU WANT TO BUILD FROM SOURCE] (i used 8.10.2 but I think anything above 7.x.x should work)
* Java (I used jdk 21)


## How to run
Prebuilt .jar files for both client and server are located here:
#### CLIENT
```
tcp_project_client/build/libs/tcp_project_client-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
#### SERVER
```
tcp-project/build/libs/tcp-project-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
Both can be executed by running 
```
java -jar <jar-file>
```

### Building from source
If you want to build from the source code the jar file will appear at the same locations as above if you run:
```
gradle build
```
in either tcp-project (server) or tcp_project_client (client) root directories.



## Instructions 
You can use exit to kill clients 
kill server by using ctrl-c

Other than that, just use the program as intended by the assignment document on blackboard.
* Start up the server
* Start up as many clients as you want
* Message to your heart's content
* Close as many clients as you want
* Connect new clients 
* Exit out of the clients
* Exit out of server
